# IP Extras Packet Capture
Collection of Wireshark `.pcapng` files. Currently contains:
  - IPv4 Options
  - IPv6 Extension Headers
  - UDP vs. UDP-Lite examples for IPv4 and Ipv6

## Usage and Warranty
I recommend using these files to see "what right looks like" and to use
as references during your own design and troubleshooting efforts. I am
not liable for any damages caused by the packet captured provided therein.
All addresses used (IP, MAC, etc.) are examples from lab environments
and any overlap in your production environment is coincidental.

Wireshark defaults to ignoring UDP-Lite checksums which can be
changed under Preferences > Protocols > UDP-Lite if desired.
