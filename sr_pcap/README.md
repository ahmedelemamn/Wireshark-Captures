# Segment Routing (SR) Packet Captures
Collection of Wireshark `.pcapng` files. Currently contains:
  - SR topology transmission over OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP-LS
  - Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) initialization
  - BGP-LS initialization carrying OSPF and IS-IS TED data
  - SR OAM with various reply types
  - Stateless and stateful SR-TE tunnels using PCEP
  - SRv6 basic captures (likely more to come later)

## Usage and Warranty
I recommend using these files to see "what right looks like" and to use
as references during your own design and troubleshooting efforts. I am
not liable for any damages caused by the packet captured provided therein.
All addresses used (IP, MAC, etc.) are examples from lab environments
and any overlap in your production environment is coincidental.
