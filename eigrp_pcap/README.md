# Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Packet Captures
Collection of Wireshark `.pcapng` files of EIGRP for IPv4 and IPv6, including:
  - Neighbor initialization
  - MD5 and SHA256 authentication schemes
  - Convergence events
  - Stuck-in-active (SIA) events
  - Classic-mode/named-mode interoperability
  - Stub router behavior
  - Multicast and unicast neighbors
  - Over The Top (OTP) with LISP encapsulation (decode as "LISP Data")
  - Various parameter mismatches for IPv4 and IPv6

## Usage and Warranty
I recommend using these files to see "what right looks like" and to use
as references during your own design and troubleshooting efforts. I am
not liable for any damages caused by the packet captured provided therein.
All addresses used (IP, MAC, etc.) are examples from lab environments
and any overlap in your production environment is coincidental.
