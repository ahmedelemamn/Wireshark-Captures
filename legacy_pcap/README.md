## Usage and Warranty
I recommend using these files to see "what right looks like" and to use
as references during your own design and troubleshooting efforts. I am
not liable for any damages caused by the packet captured provided therein.
All addresses used (IP, MAC, etc.) are examples from lab environments
and any overlap in your production environment is coincidental.
